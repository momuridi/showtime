## Showtime - A Docker Container that shows the desired time zone
This project started as a python project that was made into a python package with `poetry`.

A Docker Container was further developed which uses an environment to print out the date and time of the given time zone.

The Format is `DD.MM.YYY HH:MM`

To build and run the Docker Container:
```
docker compose up
```
